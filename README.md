# GradeNet

GradeNet is a tool for online recognition of grades when changing the study program or the currently used examination regulations. The tool was developed in the *programming language **Scala*** together with the *framework **Play***. A database is used to store requests and their associated data. There should be an admin area, through which one can manage the appreciations of the students and give them a status that informs about the current status of the appreciation.

## How to install and run?
To successfully run the Scala application, you first need the ***Scala Build Tool*** (*SBT*), which you can download for all platforms at the following address:
https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

After successful installation, start the respective development environment of your choice. We're using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html#section=windows) from NetbRains for this tutorial. If you pulled the most current version of the application over the familiar Git commands, you can start integrating with IntelliJ. 

![Welcome page IntelliJ](https://i.ibb.co/V0F7WHm/img01.png)
To do this, **start the program** and, before you start importing the project, call up the **plugin settings** at the bottom right by navigating in `Configure> Plugins`. 

![Scala plugin](https://i.ibb.co/zJZLGKT/img02.png)
It should open the following window, here you are looking for the plugin "**Scala**" and **install this**. After successful installation, it may be **necessary to restart** the development environment. After doing this, please start the IDE again and select on the start page under "**Import**" the directory path where you saved the project.

This completes the integration of the project. The project can now be compiled in the terminal with the command `sbt compile` and executed with command `sbt run`. Alternatively, a run configuration can be created in the IntelliJ development environment. To do this, a new configuration must first be created under `Run>Edit Configurations`. The pre-made template "Play 2 App" can be used here.

## Prepare the database
The application uses a database, here is the choice between a **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/de/)** and a **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** database. Standard is a PostgreSQL database. If you prefer to use a MySQL database instead, please read the section "[Switch database or change database access](#switch-database-or-change-database-access)" below.

Both databases must have at least one database named `Gradenet`. This must be accessible with the following user access, which also has **full read and write access** to the database:

| **Database** | **Username** | **Password** |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **MySQL** | mysql | mysql |
| **PostgreSQL** | postgres | postgres |

### Switch database or change database access
If you want to switch between MySQL and PostgreSQL database, you can do this in `application.conf` in the `db.default` section. Comment out the unused database! Also changing the access data happens there. To change the username and password you only have to change the variables `default.username` and `default.password`.

```
db {
    [...]
    default.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
    default.url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/gradenet"
    default.username = ""
    default.password = ""
    [...]
}
```
